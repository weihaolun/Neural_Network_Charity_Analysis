# Neural Network Charity Analysis with Neural Networks and Deep Learning

## Overview

### Background

Beks is a data scientist and programmer for the nonprofit foundation, Alphabet Soup. Now, she is going to put her skills to work to help the foundation predict where to make investment. From Alphabet Soupâ€™s business team, Beks received a CSV containing more than 34,000 organizations that have received funding from Alphabet Soup over the years. Within this dataset are a number of columns that capture metadata about each organization.

### Purpose

I will use my knowledge of machine learning and neural networks and use the features in the provided dataset to help Beks create a binary classifier that is capable of predicting whether applications will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.

There are four deliverables in this project:

1.	 Preprocessing Data for a Neural Network Model
2.	 Compile, Train, and Evaluate the Model
3.	 Optimize the Model
4.	 A Written Report on the Neural Network Model
